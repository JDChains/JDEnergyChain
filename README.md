# JDEnergyChain


This is a software platform on which peers (either energy sellers or buyers) trade energy with others. Energy
    sellers list the items, i.e. their surplus energy over half an hour, for sale. Energy buyers browse all the listed
    items and then place orders. Each order contains the information including the time period for the energy
    exchange,
    the amount of energy to be exchanged, the price of the energy to be exchanged and the details about the seller and
    buyer, e.g. the identities, the ratings of energy supply reliability, etc. Alternatively, energy sellers can also
    browse the items listed by energy buyers, i.e. the required energy over half an hour, and then place orders.
